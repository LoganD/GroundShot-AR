Groundshot AR - Built for COMS 4172 3D User Interfaces and Augmented Reality - Spring 2013
==========

This is an augmented reality game for windows phone that is a take on wack-a-mole, but uses an on screen slingslot to hit targets instead. A an oversized QR code is printed out on a piece of paper and placed on a flat surface. Once the game has started on the phone, the grid is detected via the camera and the gameboard is overlayed on the camera's view. Bombs and Goombas are randomly generated on the board, bombs subtract points and goombas add points. Walls will construct themselves randomly, blocking part of the game board from the user and forcing the user to physically walk around the table to keep playing. The difficulty setting of the game determines how many bombs and walls are generated. The blue triangles represent Goombas that are not in the players view. A red target shows the user where they are aiming, if the ball is going to bounce off of a wall it shows the target on the wall and where it will land.

Unfortunately, running this game is now difficult becuase the AR library it is built on top of is no longer maintained.
